# Pixel-Slayer
This project is a physical, interactive LED-based arcade game system that recreates classic video game experiences using programmable LED strips and button inputs instead of a traditional screen. The LED strips function as a moving pixel display, allowing players to visually follow gameplay through real-time light animations.
