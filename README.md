# Pixel-Slayer
This project is a physical, interactive LED-based arcade game system that recreates classic video game experiences using programmable LED strips and button inputs instead of a traditional screen. The LED strips function as a moving pixel display, allowing players to visually follow gameplay through real-time light animations.The system includes two main game modes: a rhythm-based game inspired by Guitar Hero and a classic Snake game. The rhythm game, called Pad Hero, removes the need for a guitar controller and replaces it with a custom button pad. LED “notes” travel down the strip toward a target zone, and players must press the correct buttons at the right moment to score points. As the game continues, the speed of the LEDs increases, creating a progressively more challenging experience that tests timing, reaction speed, and coordination. The second mode is a Snake game implemented entirely with LEDs, where the snake is represented by a chain of illuminated pixels that move across the strip. Players control the snake using buttons and attempt to collect an LED “apple,” which causes the snake to grow longer with each successful collection. As the snake increases in length, the game becomes more difficult and requires more precise control to avoid collisions. This project demonstrates the integration of digital electronics, programming, and game design by using a microcontroller to control addressable LED strips, read button inputs, and manage game logic in real time. It highlights problem-solving skills such as timing control, state management, and hardware debugging, while also showcasing creative use of physical components to replace a screen-based display. By combining well-known game concepts with hands-on electronics, this project delivers an engaging arcade-style experience and serves as a strong example of how interactive games can be built using hardware, code, and thoughtful system design.
